After growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, I received a BA from the University of California, Berkeley in American Studies before finishing a Masters program in World History at San Francisco State University. I then completed a doctorate at the University of California, Davis in Latin American History with a minor emphasis in environmental history. My dissertation, supervised by my advisor Charles F. Walker, was about Peruvian intellectual history in the early twentieth century. I currently live in Seattle, Washington area with my wife Nicole (a PhD in anthropology) and two young sons.
